Gemini Chatbot Project Explanation
==================================

The Gemini Chatbot is a web-based application designed to interact with users through natural language processing. It leverages Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and integrates with Google Generative AI to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.

Project Structure:
------------------
- `flaskr/`: The main directory containing the Flask application.
  - `main.py`: The primary script that initializes the Flask app, defines routes, and handles communication with the Google Generative AI API.
  - `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering the web interface.
    - `index.html`: The main HTML template for the chatbot interface, allowing users to input questions and receive responses.

Key Features:
-------------
- User-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- Integration with Google Generative AI for generating responses.
- Flask-based backend for handling requests and responses.

Usage:
------
1. Run the Flask application by executing `main.py`.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the local server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
3. Interact with the chatbot by typing questions and receiving AI-generated responses.

This project demonstrates the integration of web technologies and AI to create an interactive chatbot experience.
