Weather Module Project Explanation
==================================

The Weather Module is a web-based application designed to provide users with real-time weather information. It leverages Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and integrates with a weather API to fetch and display weather data.

Project Structure:
------------------
- `flaskr/`: The main directory containing the Flask application.
  - `main.py`: The primary script that initializes the Flask app, defines routes, and handles communication with the weather API.
  - `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering the web interface.
    - `index.html`: The main HTML template for the weather interface, allowing users to input a location and receive weather information.

Key Features:
-------------
- User-friendly web interface for displaying weather information.
- Integration with a weather API for fetching real-time weather data.
- Flask-based backend for handling requests and responses.

Usage:
------
1. Run the Flask application by executing `main.py`.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the local server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).
3. Enter a location to receive real-time weather information.

This project demonstrates the integration of web technologies and APIs to create an interactive weather information service.
